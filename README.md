# Biodivine Boolean Models

A collection of publicly available Boolean networks from various sources. For each model, multiple `.sbml` and `.aeon` files can be present with different variants of the model. A `model.txt` file should describe where the model originates and what variants are available.

Integrity of all models is validated using our tool [Aeon](http://biodivine.fi.muni.cz/aeon/), where you can also modify the models and explore their attractors.

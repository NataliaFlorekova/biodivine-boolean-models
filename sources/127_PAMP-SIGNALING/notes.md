### Modifications

Variables `RIPK1 (sa421)`, `ubiquitin_proteasome_complex_complex (csa87)` removed becuase they are not connected to the rest of the network. Additionally, the regulatory graph was modified to ensure consistency with the update functions:

 - Regulation `Orf3b (sa356) -> IRF3_phosphorylated_cell (sa119)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `Orf8 (sa355) -> IRF3_phosphorylated_cell (sa119)` marked as non-essential.
 - Regulation `Nsp3 (sa349) -> IRF3_phosphorylated_cell (sa119)` marked as non-essential.

### Modifications

To ensure network inputs are canonically represented, the auto-regulated identity update function of `CycD (S_5)` has been removed.

Additionally, the following regulations were modified to ensure consistency of update functions with the regulatory graph:

 - Regulation `UbcH10 (S_10) -> CycA (S_7)` sign set to `unknown`.
 - Regulation `CycE (S_2) -> p27 (S_9)` sign set to `unknown`.

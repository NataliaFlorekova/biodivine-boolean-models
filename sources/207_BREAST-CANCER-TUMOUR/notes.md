### Modifications

The model is constructed automatically from the regulations list. Every function states that *some* activator must be present and no inhibitor must be present in order to activate. As such, we don't need to state the actual regulations because they are clearly correct.

The presented model is actually based on the model available on github, but we merge the two update functions of the `RELA` node in order to follow the rule stated above.

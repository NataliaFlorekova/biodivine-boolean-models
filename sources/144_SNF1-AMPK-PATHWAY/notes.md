### Modifications

The model is available as `.bnet` and `.booleannet`, but the original `.bnet` also contains additional simulation metadata, so we base the model on the `.booleannet` version instead. As usual, inputs are normalized by removing constant/identity update functions and variables are renamed to remove invalid symbols.

### Modifications

The model was exported through OCR into `source.transcribed.ginml` from the original `source.raw.pdf` (since the copy/paste functionality is rather broken in the pdf). However, since the resulting `ginml` file cannot be opened in GINsim (interestingly, no error is given), the model was then transformed to `source.aeon` by hand (and a bunch of regexes).

### Modifications

The model is reconstructed from the attached table as `.aeon` file. It is also published as `.ginml` file, but only as a `.pdf` of screenshots :(

However, note that there seem to be some inconsistencies between rules in the table and rules in the `.ginml` file (and some also within the table itself---see `Proliferation`). Adding a `E2F1 -> EZH2` regulation was necessary as well. Finally, regulation `p53_K -> BAX` sign had to be changed to `unknown`.
